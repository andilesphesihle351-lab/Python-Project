# 🚀 My Python Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Python portfolio!  
These projects were created and tested using a mobile phone, proving that coding can be done anywhere with creativity and passion.

This portfolio includes simple but useful Python programs that I can build, customize, or improve for clients.  
If you need a custom script, automation, school project, or tool — I can create it.
